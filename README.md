This project is replica of the game "Concentration". Every code in this project you see is 100% customized and highlights my love for my dog and my favorite athletes as a child and today. Every part of this project will show you how do the following:

* Create a custom HTML, JS and CSS file.
* Showcase how to code pictures into squares into a big square.
